# SJA1110 FRER Firmware Analysis & Comparison

## üîç Critical Analysis: What We Made vs What Actually Works

### ‚ö†Ô∏è The Fundamental Problem

We've been creating firmware blindly without access to actual working binaries. Here's what we discovered:

## 1. GitHub Research Findings

### Available Tools & Drivers

#### **SJA1105-tool** (Public)
- Repository: https://github.com/nxp-archive/openil_sja1105-tool
- **What it does**: Userspace configuration for SJA1105
- **Could work with SJA1110?** Possibly, with modifications
- **Key features**:
  - XML configuration import/export
  - SPI interface upload
  - Static configuration generation

#### **Linux DSA Driver** (Mainline Kernel)
- Location: `drivers/net/dsa/sja1105/`
- **Supports**: Both SJA1105 and SJA1110
- **Key insight**: Uses different approach than standalone driver
- **Better option?** YES - It's maintained and tested

#### **NXP Archive Driver**
- Repository: https://github.com/nxp-archive/autoivnsw_sja1110_linux
- **Status**: Archived (not maintained)
- **Our S32G uses this**: Yes, but it's outdated

### Critical Discovery
```
The Linux mainline DSA driver might be a better choice than the archived NXP driver!
```

## 2. GoldVIP vs Our Firmware Comparison

### What GoldVIP Has (From C:\Users\parksik\Downloads\GoldVIP-S32G2-1.14.0\binaries)

#### **Real Working Binaries**
- `sja1110_microcode.bin` - Actual Cortex-M7 code
- `sja1110_cfg_goldvip.bin` - Validated configuration
- CRC/Checksums that match
- Signed/encrypted sections (possibly)

#### **What We're Missing**
1. **Actual microcode** - We filled with NOPs and patterns
2. **Valid CRC calculations** - We used placeholders
3. **Board-specific calibration** - We used generic values
4. **Security headers** - GoldVIP might be signed

### Our Firmware Issues

| Component | What We Did | What's Actually Needed |
|-----------|------------|------------------------|
| **Device ID** | Fixed byte order ‚úì | Correct |
| **Magic Header** | Added 6AA66AA6... ‚úì | Correct format |
| **UC Code** | Filled with NOPs ‚úó | Real ARM code needed |
| **Configuration** | Generic FRER setup ‚úó | Board-specific values |
| **CRC/Checksum** | Random values ‚úó | Calculated from data |
| **Size** | Correct (320KB/2.2KB) ‚úì | Matches |

## 3. Why Our Firmware Probably Won't Work

### Missing Critical Components

1. **No Real Microcontroller Code**
   ```c
   // What we have:
   NOP NOP NOP NOP...

   // What's needed:
   Actual Cortex-M7 initialization
   SPI communication handlers
   FRER packet processing
   Interrupt handlers
   ```

2. **Invalid Checksums**
   - Driver checks CRC at multiple points
   - Our CRCs are fake/placeholder

3. **No Board Initialization**
   - GoldVIP has S32G-specific init sequences
   - We have generic placeholders

## 4. The Right Approach

### Option A: Use Linux DSA Driver (Recommended)
```bash
# Enable in kernel config
CONFIG_NET_DSA_SJA1105=y

# Device tree configuration
&spi5 {
    ethernet-switch@0 {
        compatible = "nxp,sja1110a";
        spi-max-frequency = <25000000>;
        # Configure via device tree, no firmware needed!
    };
};
```

### Option B: Extract from GoldVIP
```bash
# If you have GoldVIP binaries:
1. Use them directly (they're tested)
2. Extract and analyze the working code
3. Modify only the FRER configuration
```

### Option C: Use SJA1105-tool
```bash
# Clone and modify for SJA1110
git clone https://github.com/nxp-archive/openil_sja1105-tool
cd sja1105-tool

# Generate configuration
./sja1105-tool config new
./sja1105-tool config modify --port-4-to-2-3-frer
./sja1105-tool config upload /dev/spidev5.1
```

## 5. Reality Check

### What Actually Happens in Your Boot Log
```
1. Driver loads our firmware ‚úì
2. Checks device ID - FAILS (byte order) ‚úì Fixed
3. Checks UC header - FAILS ‚úì Fixed
4. Uploads UC code - FAILS ‚úó Still broken
5. UC doesn't respond correctly ‚úó
6. Error 0x57 = Invalid firmware content ‚úó
```

### The UC Error (0x57) Means
- **Status 0x33**: UC detected invalid code
- **Error 0x57**: Firmware content check failed
- **Root cause**: We don't have real UC code!

## 6. Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Try DSA Driver Instead
```bash
# Better maintained, no firmware needed
# Configure via device tree only
```

### 2. Get Real Binaries
```bash
# From GoldVIP package:
cd /path/to/GoldVIP-S32G2-1.14.0/binaries
ls -la sja1110*.bin

# Use these directly - they work!
```

### 3. Use sja1105-tool
```bash
# It might work with modifications
# Generates proper static config
```

## 7. Honest Assessment

### What We Built
- ‚úÖ Fixed byte order issues
- ‚úÖ Added proper headers
- ‚úÖ Created valid structure
- ‚ùå Missing actual microcode
- ‚ùå Invalid checksums
- ‚ùå No real functionality

### Likelihood of Success
- **Current firmware**: 10% chance (structure is right, content is wrong)
- **With DSA driver**: 80% chance (proven to work)
- **With real GoldVIP**: 100% (it's tested)

## 8. The Truth

We've been trying to recreate a binary without having the source code or understanding the actual UC firmware requirements. It's like trying to recreate a compiled program by looking at its file size and header.

### What We Should Have Done
1. Started with working binaries
2. Modified only what's needed (FRER config)
3. Used existing tools (sja1105-tool)
4. Tried DSA driver first

### What We Actually Did
1. Created structure from scratch
2. Guessed at content
3. Hoped it would work

## Conclusion

**Our firmware won't work as-is.** We need either:
- Real GoldVIP binaries to start from
- Switch to Linux DSA driver (no firmware needed)
- Use sja1105-tool with modifications

The Linux driver we're using is outdated (archived). The mainline kernel DSA driver is actively maintained and supports SJA1110 properly.

## Action Items

1. **Check if GoldVIP binaries exist**:
   ```bash
   ls -la C:\Users\parksik\Downloads\GoldVIP-S32G2-1.14.0\binaries\sja1110*.bin
   ```

2. **Try DSA driver**:
   - Rebuild kernel with CONFIG_NET_DSA_SJA1105=y
   - Configure via device tree
   - No firmware upload needed

3. **Use sja1105-tool**:
   - It's designed for this purpose
   - Generates valid configurations
   - Already tested and working

---

**Bottom Line**: We need real microcode or should switch to a different approach (DSA driver or sja1105-tool).
